      "Rebecca Korach Woan is a principal and founder of Chartwell Insurance Services. She started Chartwell because she felt that high net worth individuals were often inadequately served by insurance intermediaries, and that these individuals and their families required a customized approach to property and casualty insurance which would be best handled by a dedicated, specialized brokerage. Her own interest in the art world complements the passion of Chartwell clients who are collectors; she understands the challenges of acquiring, protecting and maintaining collections. Rebecca says, ÒI am a bit of an insurance geek, I actually like reading contracts and delving into arcane insurance language.Ó\n",
