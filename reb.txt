Rebecca Korach Woan is a principal and founder of Chartwell Insurance Services. She started Chartwell because she felt that high net worth individuals were often inadequately served by insurance intermediaries, and that these individuals and their families required a customized approach to property and casualty insurance which would be best handled by a dedicated, specialized brokerage. Her own interest in the art world complements the passion of Chartwell clients who are collectors; she understands the challenges of acquiring, protecting and maintaining collections. Rebecca says, “I am a bit of an insurance geek, I actually like reading contracts and delving into arcane insurance language.”She currently serves on the governing committee of the Illinois Fair Plan and is a member of the Independent Insurance Agents of Illinois (IIA) and the Chicago Finance Exchange. She also serves on the Auxiliary Board of the Art Institute of Chicago and the ARZU Advisory Board and is a member of the Arts Club of Chicago and the Woman’s Athletic Club. Rebecca graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in International Relations and French, and obtained an MBA in Finance from the University of Chicago Booth School. Rebecca regularly comments on personal property and casualty insurance for national and local publications. She lives in Chicago with her husband and family.
