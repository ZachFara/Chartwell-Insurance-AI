Transfer of rights If we make a payment under this policy, we will assume any recovery rights a covered person has in connection with that loss, to the extent we have paid for the loss. All of your rights of recovery will become our rights to the extent of any payment we make under this policy. A covered person will do everything necessary to secure such rights; and do nothing after a loss to prejudice such rights. However, you may waive any rights of recovery from another person or organization for a covered loss in writing before the loss occurs. Concealment or fraud We do not provide coverage if you or any covered person has intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact relating to this policy before or after a loss. Application of coverage The amount of coverage applies separately to each covered person, but does not increase the amount of coverage for any one occurrence. Duplicate coverages If a loss is covered under more than one part of this policy, we will pay you under the part giving you the most coverage, but not under more than one part.

Each appraiser will be paid by the party selecting the appraiser. Other expenses of the appraisal and the compensation of the third appraiser shall be shared equally by you and us. However, we will pay your appraiser\\'s fee and the third appraiser\\'s fee if you demanded the appraisal and the full amount of loss, as set by your appraiser, is agreed to by our appraiser or by the third appraiser. We do not waive our rights under this policy by agreeing to an appraisal. Mortgagee or loss payee If a mortgagee or loss payee is named in this policy, any loss payable will be paid to the mortgagee or loss payee and you, as interests appear.

If we pay the mortgagee or loss payee for any loss and deny payment to you, then: our rights are subrogated to all rights of the mortgagee or loss payee granted under the mortgage on the property; or at our option, we may pay to the mortgagee or loss payee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer from the mortgagee or loss payee and all securities held as collateral to the debt. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee or loss payee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee\\'s or loss payee\\'s claim. Nonrenewal If we decline to renew this policy, we will mail such nonrenewal to you at the last known mailing address at least 30 days before the policy ends, with any nonrenewal reasons permitted by law.

Perils Insured Against We insure against all risks of sudden, accidental and direct physical loss or damage to an “insured vessel” that is covered under the policy occurring within the “navigational territory,” unless stated otherwise, subject to conditions, exclusions and limitations of the policy. B. Coverage and Loss Settlement We will not pay loss or damages in excess of the applicable Amount of Insurance shown on the Declarations. You agree that we may change the amounts of insurance shown on the Declarations if the policy is renewed, or when condition and value surveys or appraisals are conducted to reflect the current fair market value. 1. Insured Vessel For a covered loss to an “insured vessel,” the following provisions apply: a. For a “total or constructive total loss” to an “insured vessel,” we will pay the Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations without the application of the “deductible” shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel.” We reserve the right to keep the remains of the “insured vessel” and its proceeds. When we pay for a “total or constructive total loss,” coverage ceases upon our payment. No premium will be returned to you if we have paid you for a “total or constructive total loss” of an “insured vessel.” b. If an “insured vessel” is partially damaged and the reasonable cost of repairs is less than the Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations, we will pay the reasonable cost to repair or replace, whichever is less, the damaged part of that “insured vessel.” The repair or replacement will be of like kind and quality without deduction for depreciation up to the Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations, less the applicable “deductible” shown on the Declarations. However, we will not pay more than the “actual cash value” at the time of loss for the following: 1. Outboard motors and outdrive units greater than 10 years old at the time of the loss; 2. Sails, protective covers, upholstery, cushions, fabrics, carpets, batteries, and tires that are greater than 5 years old at the time of the loss; and 3. Inboard propulsion machinery and auxiliary machinery that are greater than 15 years of old at the time of the loss. c. If we decide to repair the damaged property, we have the option of paying for repairs: 1. In accordance with customary vessel yard repair practice, including the reasonable cost of suitable patches to damaged area; or 2. In accordance with repair procedures recommended by the builder or manufacturer of an “insured vessel”; or 3. At an amount no more than the Amount of Insurance shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel.” In case of loss of or damage to part of a pair or set, including outboard motors and outdrive units, but not inboard motors, we have the option of paying either: 1. The reasonable cost of repairing or replacing the damaged part to restore the pair or set to its condition before the loss or damage; or 2. The difference between “actual cash value” of the pair or set before and after the loss. BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 5 of 20 d. When an “insured vessel” is partially damaged by another vessel liable for the damage and the reasonable cost of repair is less than the Amount of Insurance shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel,” we will pay the reasonable cost of repairs without application of a “deductible.” e. If one side of the hull of an “insured vessel” is damaged and requires repainting or recoating, we will pay only the cost of repainting or recoating that one side less the applicable “deductible” shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel.” At our option, we may elect to pay for repainting or recoating both sides of that “insured vessel” if, in the opinion of the surveyor, repainting or recoating only the damaged side would significantly reduce the value of the “insured vessel.” f. If you choose not to have repairs made, we will pay you the “actual cash value” of repairs, less the applicable “deductible” shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel.” 2. Deductibles Unless otherwise noted in this policy or an endorsement, the greater of the “deductible” shown on the Declarations for the property involved in the “occurrence” or one of the Special “Deductibles” shown on your Declarations or in an endorsement is the amount of a covered loss you will pay. Special Windstorm Deductible If a Special Windstorm “Deductible” is shown on your Declarations or in this policy for an “Insured Vessel,” then in lieu of the “insured vessel” “deductible,” the Special Windstorm “Deductible” applies to all partial losses, or “total or constructive total losses” caused directly or indirectly by a “windstorm” for that “insured vessel.” This “deductible” is not waived in the event of a “total or constructive total loss.” The Special Windstorm “Deductible” also applies whether or not other causes or events contribute concurrently or in any sequence to the loss. C. Additional Property Coverages 1. Dinghy or Tender For a covered loss to a “dinghy or tender,” the following provisions apply: a. For a “total or constructive total loss” to a “dinghy or tender,” we will pay the Amount of Insurance shown on the Declarations for that “dinghy or tender” without the application of the “deductible” shown on the Declarations. We reserve the right to keep the remains of the “dinghy or tender” and its proceeds. When we pay for a “total or constructive total loss,” coverage ceases upon our payment. No premium will be returned to you if we have paid you for a “total or constructive total loss” of a “dinghy or tender.” b. If a “dinghy or tender” is partially damaged and the reasonable cost of repairs is less than the Amount of Insurance shown on the Declarations for that “dinghy or tender,” we will pay the lesser of the reasonable cost to repair or replace the covered “dinghy or tender.” The repair or replacement will be of like, kind and quality without deduction for depreciation up to the Amount of Insurance shown on the Declarations less the applicable “deductible” shown on the Declarations. 2. Salvage, Sue and Labor After a covered loss, you must make every reasonable effort to recover and protect an “insured vessel” or “dinghy or tender” from further loss. We will pay the reasonable costs you incur or may be obligated to pay to minimize a covered loss and prevent additional loss or damage. We will pay for salvage charges you incur arising from a covered loss. The amount we will pay for this coverage will not exceed the total Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations. All coverage provided under Salvage, Sue and Labor will terminate immediately after payment by us of a “total or constructive total loss.” There is no “deductible” for this coverage. 3. Named Storm Haul Out If the National Weather Service or the National Hurricane Center issues a “windstorm” watch or warning for the area where an “insured vessel” is located, we will pay up to $1,000 for the reasonable direct costs you incur to haul, fuel or dock the “insured vessel” because that “insured vessel” is endangered by a covered peril. We do not pay expenses for lines, anchors and other equipment to secure an “insured vessel.” The most we will pay for Named Storm Haul Out coverage is $2,000 per policy period. There is no “deductible” for this coverage. 4. Bottom Inspection We will pay the reasonable expense to inspect an “insured vessel’s” hull after grounding or striking a submerged object. There is no “deductible” for this coverage. BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 6 of 20 5. Newly Acquired Vessel We will cover a newly acquired vessel for sudden, accidental and direct physical loss unless stated otherwise, subject to all conditions, written and implied warranties, exclusions and limitations of the policy.

You must request coverage for the newly acquired vessel within 30 days after you acquire it, we must agree to insure it, and you must pay any additional premium. We may change the policy terms or conditions, cancel coverage on the newly acquired vessel, or require further conditions for continued coverage. If a covered loss occurs between the date you acquire the vessel and the date we agreed to insure it, our payment is subject to a “deductible” of 2% of the newly acquired vessel’s hull value or $500, whichever is greater. 6. Personal Effects We will cover “personal effects” that belong to you or a “family member,” the “captain,” “crew members,” guests or passengers, while the “personal effects” are being loaded on, are on board or being unloaded from an “insured vessel” or “dinghy or tender” for sudden, accidental and direct physical loss or damage arising from a peril insured against unless stated otherwise or an exclusion applies. We do not cover any loss if the “personal effects” are lost or misplaced. We will pay “replacement cost” up to the Amount of Insurance for “Personal Effects” shown on the Declarations for the applicable “insured vessel” or “dinghy or tender” for each covered loss. There is no “deductible” for this coverage. 7. Commercial Towing and Assistance We will pay the reasonable costs up to the Amount of Insurance for Commercial Towing and Assistance shown on the Declarations for an “Insured Vessel” you incur for the following services to that “insured vessel” or “dinghy or tender” should it become disabled while afloat away from its mooring, or while being transported on land on its vessel trailer, and you are forced to seek commercial assistance because civil and or voluntary help is not available: a. Towing of the “insured vessel” or “dinghy or tender” to the nearest place where required repairs can be made; b. The cost of delivery of gas, oil, or parts, excluding the cost of these items themselves; c. Labor for emergency repairs while away from your mooring or storage location; or d. Trailer road side service, including towing of trailer to the nearest place where required repairs can be made. There is no “deductible” for this coverage. However, if an “insured vessel” or vessel trailer is towed as a result of a covered loss under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE , no coverage applies under this Additional Property Coverage. 8. Trailers We will cover your trailer used with an “insured vessel.” For a covered loss to your trailer, we will pay the lesser of the reasonable cost to repair or replace the covered trailer with like, kind and quality without deduction for depreciation, up to the Amount of Insurance for Trailer shown on the Declarations for that “insured vessel.” There is no “deductible” for this coverage. 9. Temporary Substitute Vessel If an “insured vessel” is out of commission due to a covered partial loss and has not been repaired within 5 days from the date of loss, we will pay up to $2,500 to charter a vessel of similar type and of equal or lesser value and length. This coverage does not apply if an “insured vessel” was a “total or constructive total loss” or if the chartered vessel is being used for any purpose other than replacing that “insured vessel,” due to a covered loss, while it is out of commission. BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 7 of 20 10. Exhibition We will pay for sudden, accidental and direct physical loss to an “insured vessel” while it is used for exhibition at a boat show unless stated otherwise or an exclusion applies.

Gradual or Sudden Loss We do not cover any loss caused by wear and tear, gradual deterioration, delamination, weathering, fiberglass osmosis, bubbling, blistering, galvanic corrosion, rusting, electrolysis, lack of maintenance or debonding.

Cryptocurrency We do not cover any loss to cryptocurrency, electronic currency or their physical representations. SECTION III – PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE A. Protection and Indemnity Coverage We will pay “damages” for “bodily injury” or “property damage” that an “insured,” “captain” or “crew member” is legally obligated to pay arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of an “insured vessel” or BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 8 of 20 “dinghy or tender,” which is caused by an “occurrence” unless stated otherwise or an exclusion applies. This coverage includes “damages” you are legally obligated to pay as a result of liability under the Jones Act, General Maritime Law, or similar laws. We also provide you with coverage for Maritime Benefits you are legally liable to pay for: 1. Unearned wages, maintenance and cure under General Maritime Law for Jones Act seaman; and 2. Benefits payable to an injured worker under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. We will also provide a defense at our expense even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle or defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or suit at our discretion. Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. We have no duty to defend any suit or settle any claim for “bodily injury” or “property damage” not covered under this policy. If there is a maximum number crew shown on the Declarations for an “Insured Vessel,” you warrant there shall be no more than the number of “crew members” including the “captain,” in the service to that “insured vessel” at any time. If additional “crew members” are employed or in service to an “insured vessel” at any time during the policy period, you are required to give notice to us prior to any employment of such additional “crew members” and pay any additional premium we may require. If you fail to give prior notice to us and there is a greater number of “crew members” in service to an “insured vessel,” at the time of any “occurrence” giving rise to a claim under SECTION III - PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE , then we will only provide coverage to any “insured” in the proportion that the number of “crew members” agreed upon bears to the actual number of “crew members” in service to that “insured vessel” at the time of any “occurrence” giving rise to a claim. The most we will pay for all claims for damages for “bodily injury” and “property damage” as a result of any one “occurrence” is the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for an “Insured Vessel.” This coverage applies separately to each “insured” against whom a claim is made or a suit is brought, but we will not pay more than the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel” for any single “occurrence” regardless of the number of “insureds,” vessels insured, claims made or persons injured. B. Additional Protection and Indemnity Coverages We cover the following in addition to the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for the applicable “insured vessel” unless stated otherwise: 1. Claims Expenses We will pay: a. Premium on bonds for the release of an “insured vessel” if a legal authority has confiscated or detained that “insured vessel” as the result of an insured liability covered under this policy; b. Expenses we incur and court costs taxed against an “insured” in any suit we defend; c. Reasonable expenses incurred by an “insured” at our request. This includes actual loss of earnings (but not loss of other income) up to a total of $50,000, for assisting us in the investigation or defense of a claim or suit; d. Premiums on bonds required in a suit we defend. This does not apply to bond amounts more than the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. We need not apply for or furnish any bond; e. Interest on the entire judgment which accrues after entry of the judgment and before we pay or tender, or deposit in court, that part of the judgment which does not exceed the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity for the applicable “insured vessel.” This only applies to the extent the judgment does not exceed the coverage amount that applies. These payments are in addition to the limit of liability; and f. Expenses you incur to raise, remove or destroy the wreck of an “insured vessel”, if you are legally required to do so. 2. Non-Owned Vessel We will pay for “damages” you are legally obligated to pay for “bodily injury” or “property damage” caused by an “occurrence” during the policy period which results from your permissive use and operation of another vessel that is not owned, chartered or rented by you or a “family member.” However, we do not provide coverage if the other vessel is: a. A “personal watercraft”; BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 9 of 20 b. Capable of speeds in excess of 60 miles per hour; c. Is more than 10’ longer than any “insured vessel” shown on the Declarations; or d. Is furnished or available for your regular use. We will pay no more than $50,000 in “damages” for “property damage” to the non-owned vessel and its equipment subject to a $500 “deductible.” These payments do not increase the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. 3. Newly Acquired Vessel We will pay for “damages” you are legally obligated to pay for “bodily injury” or “property damage” caused by an “occurrence” during the policy period which results from the ownership, maintenance or use of any vessel you acquire, for up to 30 days after you acquire it provided the newly acquired vessel: a. Has a maximum speed of 60 mph or less; b. Is not a model year older than 15 years; and c. Is no more than 10’ longer than any “insured vessel” shown on the Declarations. You must request coverage for the newly acquired vessel within 30 days after you acquire it, we must agree to insure it, and you must pay any additional premium. We may change the policy terms or conditions, cancel coverage on the newly acquired vessel, or require further conditions for continued coverage. These payments do not increase the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. 4. Marine Environmental Damage We will pay fines, penalties, assessments, multiplication of damages, restoration costs and monitoring costs you or a “family member” is legally obligated to pay, up to $10,000 for any one “occurrence” of “marine environmental damage.” “Marine environmental damage” means the physical injury to or the alteration or destruction of coastal or marine habitat where a plant or animal naturally or normally lives through physical contact with an “insured vessel.” 5. Oil Pollution Act We will pay the reasonable costs and expenses that result from the unintentional spillage of a “contaminant” from an “insured vessel” resulting from a “covered event.” We will pay the following reasonable expenses: a.

Cleanup costs legally imposed on you by government authorities involved in the cleanup; d. Reasonable expenses incurred to defend you in a legal action from a “covered event.” “Contaminant” means any petroleum product, chemical lubricant or solvent necessary for the normal use and operation of an “insured vessel.” “Covered event” means the sudden and unexpected discharge, leakage or spillage of a contaminant from an “insured vessel” within the policy period. However, we will not pay more than the limit of liability required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 or any subsequent amendments. 6. Temporary Substitute Vessel We will pay the reasonable costs and expenses you are legally obligated to pay for “bodily injury” or “property damage” if an “insured vessel” is out of commission due to a covered partial loss and has not been repaired within 5 days from the date of loss arising from the maintenance or use of a vessel temporarily chartered by you while an “insured vessel” is being repaired. The temporarily chartered vessel must be of similar type and of equal or lesser value and length.

Insured Vessel For a covered loss to an “insured vessel,” the following provisions apply: a. For a “total or constructive total loss” to an “insured vessel,” we will pay the Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations without the application of the “deductible” shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel.” We reserve the right to keep the remains of the “insured vessel” and its proceeds. When we pay for a “total or constructive total loss,” coverage ceases upon our payment. No premium will be returned to you if we have paid you for a “total or constructive total loss” of an “insured vessel.” b. If an “insured vessel” is partially damaged and the reasonable cost of repairs is less than the Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations, we will pay the reasonable cost to repair or replace, whichever is less, the damaged part of that “insured vessel.” The repair or replacement will be of like kind and quality without deduction for depreciation up to the Amount of Insurance for that “Insured Vessel” shown on the Declarations, less the applicable “deductible” shown on the Declarations.

Sails, protective covers, upholstery, cushions, fabrics, carpets, batteries, and tires that are greater than 5 years old at the time of the loss; and 3. Inboard propulsion machinery and auxiliary machinery that are greater than 15 years of old at the time of the loss. c.

If one side of the hull of an “insured vessel” is damaged and requires repainting or recoating, we will pay only the cost of repainting or recoating that one side less the applicable “deductible” shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel.” At our option, we may elect to pay for repainting or recoating both sides of that “insured vessel” if, in the opinion of the surveyor, repainting or recoating only the damaged side would significantly reduce the value of the “insured vessel.” f.

Protection and Indemnity Coverage We will pay “damages” for “bodily injury” or “property damage” that an “insured,” “captain” or “crew member” is legally obligated to pay arising out of the ownership, maintenance, use, loading or unloading of an “insured vessel” or BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 8 of 20 “dinghy or tender,” which is caused by an “occurrence” unless stated otherwise or an exclusion applies. This coverage includes “damages” you are legally obligated to pay as a result of liability under the Jones Act, General Maritime Law, or similar laws. We also provide you with coverage for Maritime Benefits you are legally liable to pay for: 1. Unearned wages, maintenance and cure under General Maritime Law for Jones Act seaman; and 2. Benefits payable to an injured worker under the Longshore and Harbor Workers’ Compensation Act. We will also provide a defense at our expense even if the suit is groundless, false or fraudulent. We may investigate and settle or defend, as we consider appropriate, any claim or suit at our discretion. Our duty to settle or defend ends when our limit of liability for this coverage has been exhausted by payment of judgments or settlements. We have no duty to defend any suit or settle any claim for “bodily injury” or “property damage” not covered under this policy. If there is a maximum number crew shown on the Declarations for an “Insured Vessel,” you warrant there shall be no more than the number of “crew members” including the “captain,” in the service to that “insured vessel” at any time. If additional “crew members” are employed or in service to an “insured vessel” at any time during the policy period, you are required to give notice to us prior to any employment of such additional “crew members” and pay any additional premium we may require. If you fail to give prior notice to us and there is a greater number of “crew members” in service to an “insured vessel,” at the time of any “occurrence” giving rise to a claim under SECTION III - PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE , then we will only provide coverage to any “insured” in the proportion that the number of “crew members” agreed upon bears to the actual number of “crew members” in service to that “insured vessel” at the time of any “occurrence” giving rise to a claim. The most we will pay for all claims for damages for “bodily injury” and “property damage” as a result of any one “occurrence” is the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for an “Insured Vessel.” This coverage applies separately to each “insured” against whom a claim is made or a suit is brought, but we will not pay more than the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for that “Insured Vessel” for any single “occurrence” regardless of the number of “insureds,” vessels insured, claims made or persons injured. B. Additional Protection and Indemnity Coverages We cover the following in addition to the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for the applicable “insured vessel” unless stated otherwise: 1.

Expenses we incur and court costs taxed against an “insured” in any suit we defend; c. Reasonable expenses incurred by an “insured” at our request. This includes actual loss of earnings (but not loss of other income) up to a total of $50,000, for assisting us in the investigation or defense of a claim or suit; d. Premiums on bonds required in a suit we defend. This does not apply to bond amounts more than the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. We need not apply for or furnish any bond; e. Interest on the entire judgment which accrues after entry of the judgment and before we pay or tender, or deposit in court, that part of the judgment which does not exceed the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity for the applicable “insured vessel.” This only applies to the extent the judgment does not exceed the coverage amount that applies. These payments are in addition to the limit of liability; and f. Expenses you incur to raise, remove or destroy the wreck of an “insured vessel”, if you are legally required to do so. 2. Non-Owned Vessel We will pay for “damages” you are legally obligated to pay for “bodily injury” or “property damage” caused by an “occurrence” during the policy period which results from your permissive use and operation of another vessel that is not owned, chartered or rented by you or a “family member.” However, we do not provide coverage if the other vessel is: a.

Is furnished or available for your regular use. We will pay no more than $50,000 in “damages” for “property damage” to the non-owned vessel and its equipment subject to a $500 “deductible.” These payments do not increase the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. 3.

Has a maximum speed of 60 mph or less; b. Is not a model year older than 15 years; and c. Is no more than 10’ longer than any “insured vessel” shown on the Declarations. You must request coverage for the newly acquired vessel within 30 days after you acquire it, we must agree to insure it, and you must pay any additional premium. We may change the policy terms or conditions, cancel coverage on the newly acquired vessel, or require further conditions for continued coverage. These payments do not increase the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. 4. Marine Environmental Damage We will pay fines, penalties, assessments, multiplication of damages, restoration costs and monitoring costs you or a “family member” is legally obligated to pay, up to $10,000 for any one “occurrence” of “marine environmental damage.” “Marine environmental damage” means the physical injury to or the alteration or destruction of coastal or marine habitat where a plant or animal naturally or normally lives through physical contact with an “insured vessel.” 5.

Reasonable expenses incurred to defend you in a legal action from a “covered event.” “Contaminant” means any petroleum product, chemical lubricant or solvent necessary for the normal use and operation of an “insured vessel.” “Covered event” means the sudden and unexpected discharge, leakage or spillage of a contaminant from an “insured vessel” within the policy period. However, we will not pay more than the limit of liability required by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 or any subsequent amendments. 6. Temporary Substitute Vessel We will pay the reasonable costs and expenses you are legally obligated to pay for “bodily injury” or “property damage” if an “insured vessel” is out of commission due to a covered partial loss and has not been repaired within 5 days from the date of loss arising from the maintenance or use of a vessel temporarily chartered by you while an “insured vessel” is being repaired. The temporarily chartered vessel must be of similar type and of equal or lesser value and length. This coverage does not apply if the “insured vessel” was a “total or constructive total loss” or if the temporarily chartered vessel is being used for any purpose other than replacing that “insured vessel”, due to a covered loss, while it is out of commission. These payments do not increase the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations. BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 10 of 20 7. Marina The marina, yacht club or other similar facility shown on the Declarations where an “insured vessel” is kept is added as an additional interest on this policy but only for any liability arising out of the acts, errors or omissions of an “insured” with respect to that “insured vessel.” The additional interest is named as such for the sole purpose of “bodily injury” and “property damage” arising out of the “insured’s” ownership, maintenance and use of that “insured vessel.” These payments do not increase the Amount of Insurance for Protection and Indemnity shown on the Declarations for the applicable “insured vessel.” C.

If we make a change which broadens coverage under this edition of your policy without an additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date we implement the change in your state.

Concealment, Fraud or Misrepresentation This policy was issued in reliance upon the information you provided to us when you applied for the policy.

Make incorrect statements or representations to us with regard to any material fact or circumstance; 2. Conceal or misrepresent any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engage in fraudulent conduct; BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 18 of 20 in connection with a requested change, we may void the policy or reform it as it existed immediately prior to the requested change. We may do this at any time, including after an accident or loss. When we have not voided or reformed the policy, we may still deny coverage for an accident or loss if you, in connection with the policy application, in connection with any requested change, or at any time during the policy period, have concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance or engaged in fraudulent conduct and that concealment, misrepresentation or fraudulent conduct was material to a risk we assumed. I. Conformity to Law Any dispute regarding coverage afforded under the policy shall be governed by the rules and principles of General Maritime Law or Federal Admiralty Law. In the event that a rule of Federal Admiralty Law does not exist, then the dispute regarding the coverage afforded under the policy shall be governed by the law of the State appearing in your address shown on the Declarations will apply without giving effect to any conflict of laws or provisions thereof. Any dispute regarding the coverage afforded under the policy shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. federal district court for the district within which the “insured” resides or the district within which the policy was delivered. J. Conformity to Trade Sanctions This insurance does not apply to the extent that trade or economic sanctions or other laws or regulations prohibit us from applying insurance. K. Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency of an “insured” will not relieve us of our duties under this policy. L. Death of an Insured In the event of the death of an “insured,” this policy will cover the legal representative of the deceased for the remainder of the Policy Period unless cancelled. We will cover the legal representative of the deceased only with respect to an “insured vessel” of the deceased covered under this policy at the time of death. M. Suit Against Us You agree not to bring legal action against us unless you have first complied with all terms and conditions of this policy. For coverage under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE , you also agree to bring any action against us within one year after a loss occurs, but not until 30 days after proof of loss has been submitted to us and the amount of loss has been determined, or within one year after the date the loss has been denied in whole or in part. For coverage under SECTION III – PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE , you also agree not to bring any action against us until one year after the amount of “damages” you are legally obligated to pay has been finally determined after an actual trial or appeal, if any, or by a written agreement between you, us and the claimant. No person or organization has any right under this policy to bring us into any action to determine the liability of an “insured.” N. Loss Payment We will pay you for losses covered under this policy under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE within 30 days once an agreement with you is reached and you have complied with Your Duties After an Accident or Loss condition. We will pay you unless some other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. O. Mediation or Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE , either may: 1. Demand mediation of the claim, prior to taking legal action. The request must state: a. Why mediation is being requested; and b. The issues in dispute which are to be mediated. 2. Demand an appraisal of the loss . Each party selects an independent, accredited marine surveyor to act as an appraiser. In this event, the parties must notify each other of their selection within 20 days. The appraisers will state separately, the value of the property and amount of loss. If they fail to agree, the two appraisers will choose a third accredited marine surveyor to act as an arbitrator. The arbitrator will be selected within 15 days. If the appraisers chosen by the parties do not agree on an arbitrator, either party may then request that the selection be made by a judge of a court of jurisdiction over the loss. The two appraisers will then arbitrator. A decision, in BRM B1 0001 (09/22) Page 19 of 20 writing, agreed to by the two appraisers or one appraiser and the arbitrator will be binding. Each appraiser will be paid by the party selecting them. You and we will share the expense of the arbitrator equally. P. Other Insurance 1. If a loss covered under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE of this policy is also covered by: a. Other insurance issued by other than a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss. However, our coverage for “property damage” is excess over any compulsory insurance you are required to obtain by the law of the local government for any countries outside the United States, its territories or possession, listed within your “navigational territory.” b. A service agreement; this insurance is excess over any amounts payable under any such agreement. Service agreement means a service plan, vessel restoration plan, vessel warranty or other similar service warranty agreement, even if it is characterized by insurance. c. Other insurance issued by a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the amount of insurance that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss unless stated elsewhere in this policy that only one of the policies will apply. In no case will duplicate payments be made. We will not pay for any loss for any item that is specifically scheduled and covered under another policy. 2. Any coverage under SECTION III – PROTECTION AND INDEMNITY COVERAGE will be excess over other valid and collectible insurance, including any compulsory insurance you are required to obtain by the law of the local government for any countries outside the United States, its territories or possessions, listed within your “navigational territory,” except insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy. 3. For any coverage under SECTION IV - MEDICAL PAYMENTS COVERAGE , we will pay only our share of the loss. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits. However, any insurance we provide with respect to a vessel you do not own, including any vessel while used as a temporary substitute vessel, shall be excess over any other collectible insurance providing payments for medical payments. 4. If there is other applicable insurance available under one or more policies or provisions of coverage that is similar to the insurance provided under this SECTION V- UNINSURED or UNDERINSURED BOATERS LIABILITY COVERAGE of the policy: a. Any recovery for “damages” under all such policies or provisions of coverage may equal but not exceed the highest applicable Amount of Insurance for any one vessel under any insurance providing coverage on either a primary or excess basis. b. If the coverage under this policy is provided: (1) On a primary basis, we will pay only our share of the loss that must be paid under insurance providing coverage on a primary basis. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits of liability for coverage provided on a primary basis. (2) On an excess basis, we will pay only our share of the loss that must be paid under insurance providing coverage on an excess basis. Our share is the proportion that our limit of liability bears to the total of all applicable limits of liability for coverage provided on an excess basis. Q. Loss Payee 1. If a Loss Payee is named in this policy, any covered loss payable will be paid to the loss payee and you, as interests appear. If more than one loss payee is named in this policy, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the loss payees. 2. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, we will give the loss payee the same advance notice we give to the “insured” shown on the Declarations. 3. If we pay the loss payee for any loss and deny payment to you we are subrogated to all the rights of the loss payee granted under the loan on the property. 4. Subrogation will not impair the right of the loss payee to recover the full amount of the loss payee’s claim. R. Cancellation 1.

Automatic Termination If we offer to renew or continue and you or your representative do not accept, this policy will automatically terminate at the end of the current policy period. Failure to pay the required renewal or continuation premium when due shall mean that you have not accepted our offer. U. No Benefit to Bailee We will not recognize any assignment or grant any coverage that benefits a person or organization holding, storing or moving property for a fee regardless unless otherwise stated in this policy. V. Impairment of Recovery If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment was made has a right to recover damages from another we assume those recovery rights to the limit of our loss payment amount. That person shall do: 1. Whatever is necessary to enable us to exercise our rights; and 2. Nothing after loss to prejudice them. If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment is made recovers damages from another, that person shall: 1. Hold in trust for us the proceeds of the recovery; and 2. Reimburse us to the extent of our payment. However, you may waive your rights of recovery if you sign a written contract for repair of an “insured vessel” as a result of a covered loss, or if you sign a written contract for dockage, slip rental, moorage, hauling/launching, or storage of that “insured vessel.” W. Abandonment of Property You will, if asked by us, transfer title of property we insure to us or to a salvage buyer designated by us. We are not obligated to accept any property you abandon. X.

We will pay this amount whether or not you actually repair or rebuild. You must still maintain at least the amount of coverage for your “dwelling” and “other structures” as previously agreed to, including any adjustments we make when the policy renews or when appraisals are conducted. “Reconstruction cost” less depreciation will remain the loss settlement provision until all construction is completed and you and we agree on the amount of coverage for your “dwelling” and “other structures.” 4.

R. Berkley Corporation regardless of the number of policies providing you with “contents” coverage. There is no coverage provided under this paragraph d. for a loss to “contents” caused by wind.

If a change resulting from paragraphs 1., 2. or 3. above requires a premium adjustment, we will make the premium adjustment in accordance with our manual rules. 5. If we make a change which broadens coverage under this edition of your policy without an additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date we implement the change in your state. This paragraph 5. does not apply to changes implemented with a general program revision that includes both broadening and restrictions in coverage, whether that general program revision is implemented through the introduction of: a. A subsequent edition of your policy; or b. An amendatory endorsement. G. Fraud or Misrepresentation This policy was issued in reliance upon the information you provided to us when you applied for the policy. We may void this policy at any time, including after an accident or loss, if you: 1. Made incorrect statements or representations to us with regard to any material fact or circumstance; 2. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; at the time of application. This means that we will not be liable for any loss to property, claims or “damages” that would otherwise be covered. Any changes we make at your request to this policy after inception will be made in reliance upon information you provide. If you: 1. Make incorrect statements or representations to us with regard to any material fact or circumstance; 2. Conceal or misrepresent any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engage in fraudulent conduct; in connection with a requested change, we may void the policy or reform it as it existed immediately prior to the requested change. We may do this at any time, including after an accident or loss. When we have not voided or reformed the policy, we may still deny coverage for an accident or loss if you, in connection with the policy application, in connection with any requested change, or at any time during the policy period, have concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance or engaged in fraudulent conduct and that concealment, misrepresentation or fraudulent conduct was material to a risk we assumed. H. Conformity to Law If any part of this policy conflicts with state or local law, this policy is amended to conform to those laws. I. Conformity to Trade Sanctions This insurance does not apply to the extent that trade or economic sanctions or other laws or regulations prohibit us from applying insurance. J. Liberalization Clause If a change is made which broadens coverage under this edition of our policy without any premium charge, the change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date we made the change in your state. K. Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency of an “insured” will not relieve us of our duties under this policy. HO B1 0001 (11/21) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission. Page 25 of 27 L. Death of an Insured In the event of the death of an “insured,” this policy will cover the legal representative of the deceased for the remainder of the Policy Period unless cancelled. We will cover the legal representative of the deceased only with respect to the premises and property of the deceased covered under this policy at the time of death. M. Suit Against Us You agree not to bring legal action against us unless you have first complied with all terms and conditions of this policy. For coverage under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE , you also agree to bring any action against us within one year after a loss occurs, but not until 30 days after proof of loss has been submitted to us and the amount of loss has been determined, or within one year after the date the loss has been denied in whole or in part. For coverage under SECTION III – LIABILITY COVERAGE , you also agree not to bring any action against us until the amount of “damages” you are legally obligated to pay has been finally determined after an actual trial or appeal, if any, or by a written agreement between you, us and the claimant. No person or organization has any right under this policy to bring us into any action to determine the liability of an “insured.” N. Loss Payment We will pay you within 30 days once an agreement with you is reached and you have complied with Your Duties After a Loss condition. We will pay you unless some other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. O. Mediation or Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may: 1. Demand mediation of the claim, prior to taking legal action. The request must state: a. Why mediation is being requested; and b. The issues in dispute which are to be mediated. Only one mediation may be requested for each claim, unless all parties agree to further mediation. A party demanding mediation shall not be entitled to demand or request mediation after a suit is filed relating to the same facts already mediated. The parties must jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator. If the parties are unable to agree upon the appointment of a mediator within seven (7) days after a party has given notice of a demand to mediate the dispute, any party may apply to the JAMS Mediation Service, or such other organization or person agreed to by the parties in writing, for appointment of a mediator. The mediator will notify the parties of the date, time and place of the mediation conference. This conference will be held within forty-five (45) days of the mediation request. If feasible, the conference may be held by telephone. The mediation shall be conducted as an informal process and formal rules of evidence and procedure need not be observed. Participants must: a. Have authority to make a binding decision; and b. Mediate in good faith. If the mediator determines that both parties have mediated in good faith, the costs of the mediation shall be shared equally by both parties. 2. Demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent impartial appraiser with no financial interest in the outcome of the decision within twenty (20) days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within fifteen (15) days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the “residence premises” is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two of the three parties will set the amount of the loss. Each party will: a. Pay its own appraiser; and b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. HO B1 0001 (11/21) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission. Page 26 of 27 If, however, we demanded the mediation and either party rejects the mediation results, you are not required to submit to, or participate in, any appraisal of the loss as a precondition to action against us for failure to pay the loss. P. Other Insurance 1. If a loss covered under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE of this policy is also covered by: a. Other insurance issued by other than a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss. b. A service agreement; this insurance is excess over any amounts payable under any such agreement. Service agreement means a service plan, property restoration plan, home warranty or other similar service warranty agreement, even if it is characterized by insurance. c. Other insurance issued by a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss unless stated elsewhere in this policy that only one of the policies will apply. However, when both Collectible Suite coverage and “contents” coverage apply to a covered loss, the amount of coverage will be the combined total of “contents” coverage, subject to special limits and all policy provisions, and the Collectible Suite Coverage. d. Other insurance, a service agreement, a protection plan or a guarantee provided by, on behalf of, or through a home-sharing network platform, or similar entity, covering the same property covered by this policy, this insurance is primary with respect to the amount due under such other insurance, service agreement, protection plan or guarantee. In no case will duplicate payments be made. We will not pay for any loss for any item that is specifically scheduled and insured under another policy. 2. Any coverage under SECTION III - LIABILITY COVERAGE will be excess over other valid and collectible insurance except insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy. However, if this policy and any other liability insurance issued to you by us, other than insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of those policies, apply to the same “occurrence,” the maximum limit of our liability under all of the policies shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of liability under any one policy. As used in this Other Insurance provision, “other valid and collectible insurance” includes a protection plan or guarantee provided by or on behalf of or through a home-sharing network platform or similar entity covering such rental activities. Q. Mortgage Clause 1. If a mortgagee is named in this policy, any covered loss to “dwelling” or “other structures” will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named in this policy, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages. 2. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee: a. Notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware; b. Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and c. Submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within sixty (60) days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so. 3. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, we will notify the mortgagee at least thirty (30) days before the date cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect. 4. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you: a. We are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property; or b. At our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt. 5. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee’s claim. R. Cancellation 1. You may cancel this policy at any time by returning it to us or by letting us know in writing of the date cancellation is to take effect.

No Benefit to Bailee We will not recognize any assignment or grant any coverage that benefits a person or organization holding storing or moving property for a fee regardless of any other provision in this policy. U. Our Right to Recover Payment If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment was made has a right to recover damages from another we shall be subrogated to that right. That person shall do: 1. Whatever is necessary to enable us to exercise our rights; and 2. Nothing after loss to prejudice them. If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment is made recovers damages from another, that person shall: 1. Hold in trust for us the proceeds of the recovery; and 2. Reimburse us to the extent of our payment. You may waive any rights of recovery from another person or organization for a covered loss in writing before the loss occurs. V. Abandonment of Property We need not accept any property abandoned by an “insured.” W. Previously Damaged Property Any payment we make for a covered loss to covered property will be reduced by the amount paid by any insurer, including us, for a previous loss to the same covered property if you failed to properly repair or replace the covered property.

Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; at the time of application.

H. Conformity to Law If any part of this policy conflicts with state or local law, this policy is amended to conform to those laws. I. Conformity to Trade Sanctions This insurance does not apply to the extent that trade or economic sanctions or other laws or regulations prohibit us from applying insurance. J. Liberalization Clause If a change is made which broadens coverage under this edition of our policy without any premium charge, the change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date we made the change in your state. K. Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency of an “insured” will not relieve us of our duties under this policy. L. Death of an Insured In the event of the death of an “insured,” this policy will cover the legal representative of the deceased for the remainder of the Policy Period unless cancelled.

For coverage under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE , you also agree to bring any action against us within one year after a loss occurs, but not until 30 days after proof of loss has been submitted to us and the amount of loss has been determined, or within one year after the date the loss has been denied in whole or in part. HO B1 0002 (11/21) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission. Page 22 of 24 For coverage under SECTION III – LIABILITY COVERAGE , you also agree not to bring any action against us until the amount of “damages” you are legally obligated to pay has been finally determined after an actual trial or appeal, if any, or by a written agreement between you, us and the claimant. No person or organization has any right under this policy to bring us into any action to determine the liability of an “insured.” N. Loss Payment We will pay you within 30 days once an agreement with you is reached and you have complied with Your Duties After a Loss condition. We will pay you unless some other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. O. Mediation or Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may: 1. Demand mediation of the claim, prior to taking legal action. The request must state: a. Why mediation is being requested; and b. The issues in dispute which are to be mediated. Only one mediation may be requested for each claim, unless all parties agree to further mediation. A party demanding mediation shall not be entitled to demand or request mediation after a suit is filed relating to the same facts already mediated. The parties must jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator. If the parties are unable to agree upon the appointment of a mediator within seven (7) days after a party has given notice of a demand to mediate the dispute, any party may apply to the JAMS Mediation Service, or such other organization or person agreed to by the parties in writing, for appointment of a mediator. The mediator will notify the parties of the date, time and place of the mediation conference. This conference will be held within forty-five (45) days of the mediation request. If feasible, the conference may be held by telephone. The mediation shall be conducted as an informal process and formal rules of evidence and procedure need not be observed. Participants must: a. Have authority to make a binding decision; and b. Mediate in good faith. If the mediator determines that both parties have mediated in good faith, the costs of the mediation shall be shared equally by both parties. 2. Demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent impartial appraiser with no financial interest in the outcome of the decision within twenty (20) days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within fifteen (15) days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the “residence premises” is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two of the three parties will set the amount of the loss. Each party will: a. Pay its own appraiser; and b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. If, however, we demanded the mediation and either party rejects the mediation results, you are not required to submit to, or participate in, any appraisal of the loss as a precondition to action against us for failure to pay the loss. P. Other Insurance 1. If a loss covered under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE of this policy is also covered by: a. Other insurance issued by other than a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss. b. A service agreement; this insurance is excess over any amounts payable under any such agreement. Service agreement means a service plan, property restoration plan, home warranty or other similar service warranty agreement, even if it is characterized by insurance.

Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss unless stated elsewhere in this policy that only one of the policies will apply. However, when both Collectible Suite coverage and “contents” coverage apply to a covered loss, the amount of coverage will be the combined total of “contents” coverage, subject to special limits and all policy provisions, and the Collectible Suite Coverage. In no case will duplicate payments be made. We will not pay for any loss for any item that is specifically scheduled and insured under another policy. 2. Any coverage under SECTION III - LIABILITY COVERAGE will be excess over other valid and collectible insurance except insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy. However, if this policy and any other liability insurance issued to you by us, other than insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of those policies, apply to the same “occurrence,” the maximum limit of our liability under all of the policies shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of liability under any one policy. As used in this Other Insurance provision, “other valid and collectible insurance” includes a protection plan or guarantee provided by or on behalf of or through a home-sharing network platform or similar entity covering such rental activities.

Abandonment of Property We need not accept any property abandoned by an “insured.” V.

If we make a change which broadens coverage under this edition of your policy without an additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date we implement the change in your state. This paragraph, 5. does not apply to changes implemented with a general program revision that includes both broadening and restrictions in coverage, whether that general program revision is implemented through the introduction of: a. A subsequent edition of your policy; or b. An amendatory endorsement. G.

Page 22 of 25 When we have not voided or reformed the policy, we may still deny coverage for an accident or loss if you, in connection with the policy application, in connection with any requested change, or at any time during the policy period, have concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance or engaged in fraudulent conduct and that concealment, misrepresentation or fraudulent conduct was material to a risk we assumed. H. Conformity to Law If any part of this policy conflicts with state or local law, this policy is amended to conform to those laws. I. Conformity to Trade Sanctions This insurance does not apply to the extent that trade or economic sanctions or other laws or regulations prohibit us from applying insurance. J. Liberalization Clause If a change is made which broadens coverage under this edition of our policy without any premium charge, the change will automatically apply to your policy as of the date we made the change in your state. K. Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency of an “insured” will not relieve us of our duties under this policy. L. Death of an Insured In the event of the death of an “insured,” this policy will cover the legal representative of the deceased for the remainder of the Policy Period unless cancelled. We will cover the legal representative of the deceased only with respect to the premises and property of the deceased covered under this policy at the time of death. M. Suit Against Us You agree not to bring legal action against us unless you have first complied with all terms and conditions of this policy. For coverage under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE , you also agree to bring any action against us within one year after a loss occurs, but not until 30 days after proof of loss has been submitted to us and the amount of loss has been determined, or within one year after the date the loss has been denied in whole or in part. For coverage under SECTION III – LIABILITY COVERAGE , you also agree not to bring any action against us until the amount of “damages” you are legally obligated to pay has been finally determined after an actual trial or appeal, if any, or by a written agreement between you, us and the claimant. No person or organization has any right under this policy to bring us into any action to determine the liability of an “insured.” N. Loss Payment We will pay you within 30 days once an agreement with you is reached and you have complied with Your Duties after a Loss condition. We will pay you unless some other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment. O. Mediation or Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the amount of loss, either may: 1. Demand mediation of the claim, prior to taking legal action. The request must state: a. Why mediation is being requested; and b. The issues in dispute which are to be mediated. Only one mediation may be requested for each claim, unless all parties agree to further mediation. A party demanding mediation shall not be entitled to demand or request mediation after a suit is filed relating to the same facts already mediated. The parties must jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator. If the parties are unable to agree upon the appointment of a mediator within seven (7) days after a party has given notice of a demand to mediate the dispute, any party may apply to the JAMS Mediation Service, or such other organization or person agreed to by the parties in writing, for appointment of a mediator. The mediator will notify the parties of the date, time and place of the mediation conference. This conference will be held within forty-five (45) days of the mediation request. If feasible, the conference may be held by telephone. The mediation shall be conducted as an informal process and formal rules of evidence and procedure need not be observed. Participants must: a. Have authority to make a binding decision; and HO B1 0003 (11/21) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission. Page 23 of 25 b. Mediate in good faith. If the mediator determines that both parties have mediated in good faith, the costs of the mediation shall be shared equally by both parties. 2. Demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent impartial appraiser with no financial interest in the outcome of the decision within twenty (20) days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within fifteen (15) days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the “residence premises” is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two of the three parties will set the amount of the loss. Each party will: a. Pay its own appraiser; and b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. If, however, we demanded the mediation and either party rejects the mediation results, you are not required to submit to, or participate in, any appraisal of the loss as a precondition to action against us for failure to pay the loss. P. Other Insurance 1. If a loss covered under SECTION II – PROPERTY COVERAGE of this policy is also covered by: a. Other insurance issued by other than a subsidiary or affiliate of the W. R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss. b. A service agreement; this insurance is excess over any amounts payable under any such agreement. Service agreement means a service plan, property restoration plan, home warranty or other similar service warranty agreement, even if it is characterized by insurance. c. Other insurance issued by a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss unless stated elsewhere in this policy that only one of the policies will apply. However, when both Collectible Suite coverage and “contents” coverage apply to a covered loss, the amount of coverage will be the combined total of “contents” coverage, subject to special limits and all policy provisions, and the Collectible Suite Coverage. d. Other insurance, a service agreement, a protection plan or a guarantee provided by, on behalf of, or through a home-sharing network platform, or similar entity, covering the same property covered by this policy, this insurance is primary with respect to the amount due under such other insurance, service agreement, protection plan or guarantee. In no case will duplicate payments be made. We will not pay for any loss for any item that is specifically scheduled and insured under another policy. 2. Any coverage under SECTION III - LIABILITY COVERAGE will be excess over other valid and collectible insurance except insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of liability that apply in this policy. However, if this policy and any other liability insurance issued to you by us, other than insurance written specifically to cover as excess over the limits of those policies, apply to the same “occurrence,” the maximum limit of our liability under all of the policies shall not exceed the highest applicable limit of liability under any one policy. As used in this Other Insurance provision, “other valid and collectible insurance” includes a protection plan or guarantee provided by or on behalf of or through a home-sharing network platform or similar entity covering such rental activities. Q. Mortgage Clause 1. If a mortgagee is named in this policy, any covered loss to the “additions and alterations” will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named in this policy, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages. 2. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee: a. Notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware; HO B1 0003 (11/21) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission.

Submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within sixty (60) days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so. 3. If we decide to cancel or not renew this policy, we will notify the mortgagee at least thirty (30) days before the date cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect. 4. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you: a. We are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property; or b. At our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt. 5. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee’s claim. R. Cancellation 1. You may cancel this policy at any time by returning it to us or by letting us know in writing of the date cancellation is to take effect. 2. We may cancel this policy only for the reasons stated below by letting you know in writing of the date cancellation takes effect.

When this policy is canceled, the premium for the period from the date of cancellation to the expiration date will be refunded pro rata. 4. If the return premium is not refunded with the notice of cancellation or when this policy is returned to us, we will refund it within a reasonable time after the date cancellation takes effect. S. Nonrenewal We may elect not to renew this policy. We may do so by delivering to you, or mailing to you at your mailing address shown on your Declarations, written notice at least thirty (30) days before the expiration date of this policy. Proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice. T. No Benefit to Bailee We will not recognize any assignment or grant any coverage that benefits a person or organization holding storing or moving property for a fee regardless of any other provision in this policy. U. Our Right to Recover Payment If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment was made has a right to recover damages from another we shall be subrogated to that right. That person shall do: 1. Whatever is necessary to enable us to exercise our rights; and 2. Nothing after loss to prejudice them. If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment is made recovers damages from another, that person shall: HO B1 0003 (11/21) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission. Page 25 of 25 1. Hold in trust for us the proceeds of the recovery; and 2. Reimburse us to the extent of our payment. You may waive any rights of recovery from another person or organization for a covered loss in writing before the loss occurs. V. Abandonment of Property We need not accept any property abandoned by an “insured.” W. Previously Damaged Property Any payment we make for a covered loss to covered property will be reduced by the amount paid by any insurer, including us, for a previous loss to the same covered property if you failed to properly repair or replace the covered property.

We will pay your appraiser’s fee and the umpire’s appraisal fee, if the following conditions exist: a. You demanded the appraisal; and b.

We do not waive any of our rights under this policy by agreeing to an appraisal. INSURABLE INTEREST We will not pay for any loss to property in which you or a “family member” does not have an insurable interest at the time of the loss.

This paragraph C. does not apply to changes implemented with a general program revision that includes both broadenings and restrictions in coverage, whether that general program revision is implemented through introduction of: 1. A subsequent edition of your policy; or 2. An Amendatory Endorsement.

LEGAL ACTION AGAINST US A. No legal action may be brought against us until there has been full compliance with all the terms of this policy. In addition, under PART A – LIABILITY COVERAGE no legal action may be brought against us until: 1. We agree in writing that the “insured” has an obligation to pay; or 2. The amount of that obligation has been finally determined by judgment after trial. B. No person or organization has any right under this policy to bring us into any action to determine the liability of an “insured.” OUR RIGHT TO RECOVER PAYMENT A. If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment was made has a right to recover damages from another we shall be subrogated to that right. That person shall do: 1. Whatever is necessary to enable us to exercise our rights; and 2. Nothing after loss to prejudice them. However, our rights in this paragraph (A.) do not apply under PART D – COVERAGE FOR DAMAGE TO YOUR AUTO, against any person using “your covered auto” with a reasonable belief that that person is entitled to do so. B. If we make a payment under this policy and the person to or for whom payment is made recovers damages from another, that person shall: 1. Hold in trust for us the proceeds of the recovery; and 2. Reimburse us to the extent of our payment. POLICY PERIOD AND TERRITORY A. This policy applies only to accidents and losses which occur: 1.

That the mandated insurance is purchased or provided for the vehicle being operated, as defined by the country or jurisdiction. Our limit of liability will be only the part of a covered loss that exceeds the limit of liability of that policy. In Mexico and other countries, liability coverage must be purchased from a locally licensed insurance company to meet the liability requirements of that country. Failure to comply with this requirement may leave you uninsured with regard to liability coverage under the local law and subject to fines and other penalties. 2. The use, lease or rental of the “non-owned auto” is for a period less than 45 days. This coverage also applies to a temporarily relocated “covered auto” and “newly acquired vehicles.” TERMINATION A.

Why mediation is being requested; and b. The issues in dispute which are to be mediated. Only one mediation may be requested for each claim, unless all parties agree to further mediation. A party demanding mediation shall not be entitled to demand or request mediation after a suit is filed relating to the same facts already mediated. The parties must jointly appoint a mutually acceptable mediator. If the parties are unable to agree upon the appointment of a mediator within seven (7) days after a party has given notice of a demand to mediate the VA B1 0001 (08/21 ) Includes copyrighted material of Insurance Services Office, Inc., with its permission. Page 10 of 14 dispute, any party may apply to the JAMS Mediation Service, or such other organization or person agreed to by the parties in writing, for appointment of a mediator. The mediator will notify the parties of the date, time and place of the mediation conference. This conference will be held within forty-five (45) days of the mediation request. If feasible, the conference may be held by telephone. The mediation shall be conducted as an informal process and formal rules of evidence and procedure need not be observed. Participants must: a. Have authority to make a binding decision; and b. Mediate in good faith. If the mediator determines that both parties have mediated in good faith, the costs of the mediation shall be shared equally by both parties. 2. Demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, each party will choose a competent impartial appraiser with no financial interest in the outcome of the decision within twenty (20) days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within fifteen (15) days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the state where the covered property is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two will set the amount of the loss. Each party will: a. Pay its own appraiser; and b. Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. If, however, we demanded the mediation and either party rejects the mediation results, you are not required to submit to, or participate in, any appraisal of the loss as a precondition to action against us for failure to pay the loss. G. Other Insurance If you have a covered loss under this policy and a homeowners policy issued by us or a subsidiary or affiliate of the W.R. Berkley Corporation; we will pay only the proportion of the loss that the limit of liability that applies under this policy bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss unless stated elsewhere in this policy that only one of the policies will apply. However, when both Collectible Suite coverage and “contents” coverage apply to a covered loss, the amount of coverage will be the combined total of “contents” coverage, subject to special limits and all policy provisions, and the Collectible Suite Coverage. In no case will duplicate payments be made. We will not pay for any loss for any item that is specifically scheduled and insured under another policy. H. When any other property insurance applies to a covered loss, we will pay only the proportion of the loss that our amount of coverage bears to the total amount of insurance covering the loss. I. Suit Against Us No action can be brought unless the policy provisions have been complied with and the action is started within two years after the date of loss. You may not bring any action until 30 days after proof of loss has been filed and the amount of loss has been determined. J. Loss Payment We will pay you within 30 days once an agreement with you is reached and you have complied with Your Duties After an Occurrence condition. We will pay you unless some other person is named in the policy or is legally entitled to receive payment.

Conformity to State Law If any provision of this policy conflicts with the laws of the state in which you live, this policy is amended to conform to those laws. O. Conformity to Trade Sanction Laws This insurance does not apply to the extent that trade or economic sanctions or other laws or regulations prohibit us from providing insurance. P.

Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engaged in fraudulent conduct at the time of application. This means that we will not be liable for any loss to property, claims or “damages” that would otherwise be covered.

Make incorrect statements or representations to us with regard to any material fact or circumstance; 2. Conceal or misrepresent any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engage in fraudulent conduct in connection with a requested change, we may void the policy or reform it as it existed immediately prior to the requested change. We may do this at any time, including after an accident or loss.

To an “insured” for more than the amount of such “insureds” interest at the time of loss; or 2. For more than the applicable limit of liability. Policy Term This “policy” applies only to a covered loss which occurs during the “policy” period. Recovered Property In the event we pay for a covered loss to property and the property is recovered, we will offer you an opportunity to buy it back for the amount we paid. Changes This “policy” contains all of the agreements between you and us. Its terms may not be changed or waived except by endorsement issued by us. Our request for an appraisal or examination will not waive any of our rights. You have a duty to report to us all changes, including additions and deletions, in “policy” information. This includes, but is not limited to, the information listed in paragraphs 1. through 5. of this paragraph, D. Changes . If there is a change to the information used to develop the “policy” premium, we may adjust your premium. Changes during the “policy” term that may result in a premium increase or decrease may include: The construction of any additions, alterations or renovations to the existing Dwelling or an Other Structure shown on your Declarations; or Changes in coverage, deductibles or limits. If a change resulting from paragraphs 1., 2. or 3. above, requires a premium adjustment, we will make the premium adjustment in accordance with our manual rules. If we make a change which broadens coverage under this edition of your “policy” without an additional premium charge, that change will automatically apply to your “policy” as of the date we implement the change in your state. This paragraph 5. does not apply to changes implemented with a general program revision that includes both XF B1 0001 (05/19 ) Page 9of 13broadening and restrictions in coverage, whether that general program revision is implemented through the introduction of: A subsequent edition of your “policy”; or An amendatory endorsement.

Fraud or Misrepresentation This “policy” was issued in reliance upon the information you provided to us when you applied for the “policy.” We may void this “policy” at any time, including after an accident or loss, if you: 1. Made incorrect statements or representations to us with regard to any material fact or circumstance; 2. Concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engaged in fraudulent conduct; at the time of application. This means that we will not be liable for any loss to property claims that would otherwise be covered. Any changes we make at your request to this “policy” after inception will be made in reliance upon information you provide. If you: 1. Make incorrect statements or representations to us with regard to any material fact or circumstance; 2. Conceal or misrepresent any material fact or circumstance; or 3. Engage in fraudulent conduct; in connection with a requested change, we may void the “policy” or reform it as it existed immediately prior to the requested change. We may do this at any time, including after a loss. When we have not voided or reformed the “policy,” we may still deny coverage for a loss if you, in connection with the “policy” application, in connection with any requested change, or at any time during the “policy” period, have concealed or misrepresented any material fact or circumstance or engaged in fraudulent conduct and that concealment, misrepresentation or fraudulent conduct was material to a risk we assumed. Bankruptcy Bankruptcy or insolvency of an “insured” will not relieve us of our duties under this “policy.” Death of an Insured In the event of the death of an “insured,” this “policy” will cover the legal representative of the deceased for the remainder of the “policy” period unless cancelled. We will cover the legal representative of the deceased only with respect to the premises and property of the deceased covered under this “policy” at the time of death. Other Insurance This “policy” provides coverage that is excess of the self-insured retained limit listed on your Declarations. If you have other primary or excess insurance covering a loss also covered by this “policy,” the insurance afforded by this “policy” shall be in excess of and shall not contribute with such other insurance unless such other insurance is written only as specific excess insurance over the limits of liability of this “policy.” In any event, our duty to cover a “flood” loss does not begin until the amount of such covered “flood” loss exceeds the Self-Insured Retained Limit shown on your Declarations. Amendments, Waivers, Assignment This “policy” cannot be changed, nor can any of its provisions be waived without our express written consent. No action that we take under the terms of this “policy” constitutes a waiver of any of our rights. You may not assign this “policy.” Cancellation of the Policy You may cancel this “policy” at any time by returning it to us or notifying us in writing of the future date that the XF B1 0001 (05/19 ) Page 10of 13“cancellation” is to take effect. We may cancel this “policy” for the reasons stated below by letting you know in writing of the date cancellation takes effect. This cancellation notice may be delivered to you, or mailed to you at your mailing address shown on your Declarations. Proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice. When you have not paid the premium, we may cancel at any time by letting you know at least ten (10) days before the date cancellation takes effect. When this “policy” has been in effect for less than sixty (60) days and is not a renewal with us, we may cancel for any reason by letting you know at least ten (10) days before the date cancellation takes effect. When this “policy” has been in effect for sixty (60) days or more, or at any time if it is a renewal with us, we may cancel: (1) If there has been a material misrepresentation of fact which if known to us would have caused us not to issue the “policy”; or (2) If the risk has changed substantially since the “policy” was issued. This can be done by letting you know at least thirty (30) days before the date cancellation takes effect. Refunds and Earned Premium When this “policy” is canceled, the premium for the period from the date of cancellation to the expiration date will be refunded pro rata. If the return premium is not refunded with the notice of cancellation or when this “policy” is returned to us, we will refund it within a reasonable time after the date cancellation takes effect. However, the total annual premium will be fully earned in the event of a claim which is likely to involve this “policy” or a loss which may be covered by this “policy.” Policy Renewal and Automatic Termination We may offer to renew this “policy,” at the premiums and under the “policy” provisions in effect on the date of renewal. If you reject our offer, this “policy” will automatically terminate at the end of the current “policy” period. Failure to pay the required renewal premium in full on or before the due date means you have rejected our offer. In connection with the renewal of this “policy,” we may ask you during the “policy” term to recertify, on a Recertification Questionnaire we will provide to you, the rating information used to rate your most recent “policy.” Nonrenewal We may elect not to renew this “policy.” We may do so by delivering to you, or mailing to you at your mailing address shown on your Declarations, written notice at least thirty (30) days before the expiration date of this “policy.” Proof of mailing will be sufficient proof of notice. Your Duties After a Loss In the event of a “flood” loss for which coverage may be provided under this “policy,” you or someone acting for an “insured” must: Give prompt written notice to us, any of our agents in this state or your agent; Protect the property from further damage. If repairs to the property are required, you must: Make reasonable and necessary repairs to protect the property; and Keep an accurate record of repair expenses; Cooperate with us in the investigation of the claim or settlement; Prepare an inventory of damaged property. Show the quantity, description and amount of loss. Attach all bills, receipts, and related documents that justify the figures in the inventory; Provide a copy of the primary flood insurance policy; As often as we reasonably require: Show the damaged property Provide us with records and documents we request and permit us to make copies; and Submit to separate examination under oath; Send to us, within sixty (60) days of our request, your signed, sworn proof of loss.

With respect to any “short-term rental” activity, you must provide us as often as we reasonably require, with information concerning the number of: Rental agreements or contracts entered into by an “insured”; and Nights the “residence premises” was occupied, in whole or in part, by tenants. This does not include an “insured” or any “family member.” You must cooperate with us by executing an authorization to obtain the pertinent data and records regarding the loss, if some authorization is necessary for release of the data or records. No Benefit to Bailee No person or organization, other than you, having custody of covered property will benefit from this insurance. Loss Payment We will adjust all losses with you. We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the “policy” or is legally entitled to receive payment. Loss will be payable sixty (60) days after we receive your proof of loss (or within ninety (90) days after the insurance adjuster files the adjuster’s report signed and sworn to by you in lieu of a proof of loss) and: We reach an agreement with you; There is an entry of a final judgment; or There is a filing of an appraisal award with us, as provided in GENERAL CONDITIONS , Appraisal ; and You have complied with Your Duties After a Loss condition. If we reject your proof of loss in whole, or in part, you may: Accept our denial of your claim; Exercise your rights under this “policy”; or File an amended proof of loss, as long as it is filed within sixty (60) days of the date of the loss. Abandonment You may not abandon to us damaged or undamaged property insured under this “policy.” Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the “actual cash value” or, if applicable, “reconstruction cost” of your damaged property to settle upon the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within twenty (20) days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within fifteen (15) days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the State where the covered property is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two of the three parties will set the amount of the loss. XF B1 0001 (05/19 ) Page 12of 13Each party will: Pay its own appraiser; and Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. Mortgage Clause 1. If a mortgagee is named in this “policy,” any covered loss to your “dwelling” or “other structure” will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named in this “policy,” the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages. 2. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee: Notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware; Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and Submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within sixty (60) days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so. 3. If we decide to cancel or not renew this “policy,” we will notify the mortgagee at least thirty (30) days before the date cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect. 4. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you: We are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property; or At our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt. 5. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee’s claim. Suit Against Us You agree not to bring legal action against us unless you have first complied with all terms and conditions of this “policy.” You also agree to bring any action against us within one year after a loss occurs, but not until thirty (30) days after proof of loss has been submitted to us and the amount of loss has been determined, or within one year after the date the loss has been denied in whole or in part. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this “policy” and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the “policy.” Subrogation Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this “policy,” we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed We will not insure your property under more than one Berkley excess “flood” “policy.” If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose one of several options under the following procedures: If you choose to keep in effect the “policy” with the earlier effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the later “policy” to the limits of the earlier “policy.” The change will become effective as of the effective date of the later “policy.” If you choose to keep in effect the “policy” with the later effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the earlier “policy” to the limits of the later “policy.” The change will be effective as of the effective date of the later “policy.” In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased coverage limits within thirty (30) days of the written notice. In no event will the resulting coverage limits exceed our permissible limits of coverage or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will make a refund to you, of the premium for the “policy” not being kept in effect. XF B1 0001 (05/19 ) Page 13of 13 Your option under Duplicate Policies Not Allowed to elect which “policy” to keep in effect does not apply when duplicates have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of the earlier “policy.” The “policy” with the later effective date must be canceled. Previously Damaged Property Any payment we make for a covered loss to covered property will be reduced by the amount paid by any insurer, including us, for a previous loss to the same covered property if you failed to properly repair or replace the covered property. VI. LIBERALIZATION CLAUSE If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our “policy,” but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change. However if the “policy” is within sixty (60) days of expiration, the broader coverage will not apply until your next “policy” renewal. VII.

We will pay you unless some other person or entity is named in the “policy” or is legally entitled to receive payment.

Abandonment You may not abandon to us damaged or undamaged property insured under this “policy.” Appraisal If you and we fail to agree on the “actual cash value” or, if applicable, “reconstruction cost” of your damaged property to settle upon the amount of loss, then either may demand an appraisal of the loss. In this event, you and we will each choose a competent and impartial appraiser within twenty (20) days after receiving a written request from the other. The two appraisers will choose an umpire. If they cannot agree upon an umpire within fifteen (15) days, you or we may request that the choice be made by a judge of a court of record in the State where the covered property is located. The appraisers will separately set the amount of the loss. If the appraisers submit a written report of an agreement to us, the amount agreed upon will be the amount of the loss. If they fail to agree, they will submit their differences to the umpire. A decision agreed to by any two of the three parties will set the amount of the loss. Each party will: Pay its own appraiser; and Bear the other expenses of the appraisal and umpire equally. Mortgage Clause 1. If a mortgagee is named in this “policy,” any covered loss to your “dwelling” or “other structures” will be paid to the mortgagee and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named in this “policy,” the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgages. 2. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee, if the mortgagee: Notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee is aware; Pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and Submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within sixty (60) days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so. 3. If we decide to cancel or not renew this “policy,” we will notify the mortgagee at least thirty (30) days before the date cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect. 4. If we pay the mortgagee for any loss and deny payment to you: We are subrogated to all the rights of the mortgagee granted under the mortgage on the property; or XF B1 0002 (06/19 ) Page 13of 13 At our option, we may pay to the mortgagee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer of the mortgage and all securities held as collateral to the mortgage debt. 5. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee’s claim. Suit Against Us You agree not to bring legal action against us unless you have first complied with all terms and conditions of this “policy.” You also agree to bring any action against us within one year after a loss occurs, but not until thirty (30) days after proof of loss has been submitted to us and the amount of loss has been determined, or within one year after the date the loss has been denied in whole or in part. This requirement applies to any claim that you may have under this “policy” and to any dispute that you may have arising out of the handling of any claim under the “policy.” Subrogation Whenever we make a payment for a loss under this “policy,” we are subrogated to your right to recover for that loss from any other person. That means that your right to recover for a loss that was partly or totally caused by someone else is automatically transferred to us, to the extent that we have paid you for the loss. We may require you to acknowledge this transfer in writing. After the loss, you may not give up our right to recover this money or do anything that would prevent us from recovering it. If you make any claim against any person who caused your loss and recover any money, you must pay us back first before you may keep any of that money. Duplicate Policies Not Allowed We will not insure your property under more than one Berkley excess “flood” “policy.” If we find that the duplication was not knowingly created, we will give you written notice. The notice will advise you that you may choose one of several options under the following procedures: If you choose to keep in effect the “policy” with the earlier effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the later “policy” to the limits of the earlier “policy.” The change will become effective as of the effective date of the later “policy.” If you choose to keep in effect the “policy” with the later effective date, you may also choose to add the coverage limits of the earlier “policy” to the limits of the later “policy.” The change will be effective as of the effective date of the later “policy.” In either case, you must pay the pro rata premium for the increased coverage limits within thirty (30) days of the written notice. In no event will the resulting coverage limits exceed our permissible limits of coverage or your insurable interest, whichever is less. We will make a refund to you, of the premium for the “policy” not being kept in effect. Your option under Duplicate Policies Not Allowed to elect which “policy” to keep in effect does not apply when duplicates have been knowingly created. Losses occurring under such circumstances will be adjusted according to the terms and conditions of the earlier “policy.” The “policy” with the later effective date must be canceled. Previously Damaged Property Any payment we make for a covered loss to covered property will be reduced by the amount paid by any insurer, including us, for a previous loss to the same covered property if you failed to properly repair or replace the covered property. VI. LIBERALIZATION CLAUSE If we make a change that broadens your coverage under this edition of our “policy,” but does not require any additional premium, then that change will automatically apply to your insurance as of the date we implement the change. However, if the “policy” is within sixty (60) days of expiration, the broader coverage will not apply until your next “policy” renewal. VII. WHAT LAW GOVERNS This “policy” and all disputes arising from the handling of any claim under the “policy” are governed exclusively by state insurance law and Federal common law, as each is applicable, based on the location of your property.

Payment for a Loss Amount of coverage The amount of coverage for each house for each occurrence is shown in the Coverage Summary. To help you and us agree on the appropriate amount of coverage, we may, but are not obligated to, conduct appraisals of your house and other permanent structures and also make periodic adjustments to the amount of coverage. It is your duty to advise us of additions, alterations or renovations to your house or other permanent structures at the beginning of, throughout, and at the completion of construction so that the amount of coverage for your house or other permanent structures can be adjusted to maintain an appropriate amount of coverage based on the construction cost information you provide. At the time of a covered loss, the amount of coverage for your house will be adjusted to include any increase in the United States Consumer Price Index calculated from the beginning of the policy period. Deductibles A deductible is that amount we will subtract from the amount of a covered loss in determining the amount we will pay. Either the base deductible listed in the Coverage Summary or one or more of the special deductibles applies to each occurrence, unless stated otherwise. Special deductibles. If more than one special deductible applies to a covered loss (other than the construction deductible or the vacant house deductible), the special deductible with the greatest dollar amount applies to the covered loss. If any individual or combination of the following special deductibles applies to a covered loss, the greatest dollar amount of any other applicable special deductible and any of these applicable deductibles will be combined, and the total amount of all applicable deductibles will be applied to the covered loss: the construction deductible; or the vacant house deductible.

The dollar amount of this deductible is equal to 5% of the amount of coverage for the house as shown in the Coverage Summary at the time of a covered loss.

This construction deductible applies in addition to the greatest of any other special deductible that applies to the covered loss. Vacant house deductible. In lieu of the base deductible, a 5% special vacant house deductible applies to each occurrence if your house has been substantially empty of furnishings and contents for more than 30 consecutive days at the time of a covered loss, and you did not notify us it would be vacant. This vacant house deductible applies to your house, contents and extra coverages. The dollar amount of this deductible is equal to 5% of the amount of coverage for the house as shown in the Coverage Summary at the time of a covered loss. If your house coverage amount is increased because of extended replacement cost, the deductible will be based on the increased amount. If the dollar amount of the base deductible is greater than the dollar amount of the vacant house deductible, the dollar amount of the vacant house deductible is increased to the dollar amount of the base deductible. This vacant house deductible applies in addition to the greatest of any other special deductible that applies to the covered loss. Payment basis Your Coverage Summary indicates the payment basis for each house. \"Reconstruction cost\" means the lesser of the amount required at the time of loss to repair, replace or rebuild, at the same location, your house or any other permanent structure, using like design, and materials and workmanship of comparable kind and quality. This includes the reasonable cost for matching to ensure visual continuity with any adjacent undamaged portions of your house or other permanent structure consisting of the same materials. \"Reconstruction cost\" does not include any amount required for: the excavation, replacement or stabilization of land under or around your house or any other permanent structure; conforming to any law or ordinance that regulates the repair, replacement, rebuilding or demolition of your house or any other permanent structure; or removing the debris of a covered loss or the property that caused a covered loss. Extended replacement cost.

Conditional replacement cost will remain your payment basis until construction is completed. Your duty: It is your duty to notify your agent or broker at the beginning of, throughout, and at the completion of construction so that the amount of coverage for your house or other permanent structures can be adjusted to maintain an appropriate amount of coverage based on the construction cost information you provide. This is to reduce the possibility of being underinsured. If you cannot repair, replace, or rebuild your house because your primary mortgagee or its assignees has recalled your mortgage, we will pay the reconstruction cost up to the amount of coverage shown in the Coverage Summary for your house, minus what is due to the mortgagee. Verified replacement cost. If the payment basis is verified replacement cost, we will pay the reconstruction cost of: your house up to the amount of coverage shown in the Coverage Summary; and other permanent structures up to the amount of coverage for other permanent structures, whether or not you actually repair, replace, or rebuild.

Payment for a Loss Amount of coverage The amount of coverage for contents at each unit for each occurrence is shown in the Coverage Summary. At the time of a covered loss, the amount of coverage for contents at your unit will be adjusted to include any increase in the United States Consumer Price Index calculated from the beginning of the policy period. If this policy is renewed, the amount of coverage for your contents may be changed by us based on annual adjustments for inflation. To reduce the possibility of being underinsured, you should periodically review your amount of coverage for contents and request an increase if you feel the amount of coverage is insufficient. It is your duty to advise us of additions, alterations or renovations to your unit at the beginning of, throughout, and completion of construction so that the amount of coverage for your contents and, if applicable, your additions and alterations can be adjusted to maintain an appropriate amount of coverage based on the construction cost information you provide.

If the covered loss takes place at a listed cooperative unit covered by this policy, we will pay up to the amount of contents coverage for that cooperative unit, for each occurrence.

If this policy is renewed, the amount of coverage for your contents may be changed by us based on annual adjustments for inflation. To reduce the possibility of being underinsured, you should periodically review your amount of coverage for contents and request an increase if you feel the amount of coverage is insufficient. It is your duty to advise us of additions, alterations or renovations to your unit at the beginning of, throughout, and completion of construction so that the amount of coverage for your contents and, if applicable, your additions and alterations can be adjusted to maintain an appropriate amount of coverage based on the construction cost information you provide.

The following is added to the definitions in the Introduction: \"Spouse\" means a partner in marriage or a partner in a civil union recognized under state law. Payment for a Loss Amount of coverage The amount of coverage for each category of valuable articles, and for each itemized article, is shown in your Coverage Summary. To help you maintain an appropriate amount of coverage, if itemized jewelry is shown in your Coverage Summary, we increase the amount of coverage for each article of itemized jewelry annually by a percentage based on industry trends for jewelry values plus, if you request, an additional percentage amount. Itemized articles For a covered loss to an article listed in your schedule of itemized articles, we will pay as follows: Total loss. If an itemized article is totally destroyed or lost, we will pay the amount of itemized coverage for that article. However, if the market value of the itemized article immediately before the loss exceeds the amount of itemized coverage for that article, we will pay its market value immediately before the loss, up to 150% of the amount of itemized coverage for that article, but not more than the Maximum amount of coverage. Partial loss. If an itemized article is partially lost or damaged, you may choose either of the following: If you choose to restore the article, we will pay the costs to restore the article to its condition immediately before the loss up to the amount of itemized coverage for that article. If the article cannot be restored to its condition immediately before the loss, we will pay any loss of market value plus the restoration costs up to 150% of the amount of itemized coverage for that article. If you choose not to restore the article, we will pay any loss of market value, up to 150% of the amount of itemized coverage for that article. However, the most we will pay in any one loss is the Maximum amount of coverage. The loss of market value is determined as follows: If the amount of itemized coverage for the article is less than the market value immediately before the loss, we will apply the percentage change to the market value immediately before the loss. If the amount of itemized coverage for the article is equal to or greater than the market value immediately before the loss, we will apply the percentage change to the amount of itemized coverage for that article. \"Percentage change\" means the change in market value resulting from the covered loss, after restoration if any, expressed as a percentage. 04/25/22 Illinois Valuable Articles Coverage Page N-1 © Chubb.2016 All rights reserved.

If the restored value is less than the market value immediately prior to the loss, we will pay the difference. But we will not pay more than the amount of blanket coverage for that category.

Loss payment We will pay you within 30 days once an agreement with you is reached and you have complied with Your Duties After a Loss conditions. Insurable interest We will not pay for any loss to property in which you or a family member does not have an insurable interest at the time of the loss. If more than one person has an insurable interest in covered property, we will not pay for an amount greater than your interest, up to the amount of coverage that applies. Abandoning property You cannot abandon any property to us unless we agree to accept it, or to a third party unless we agree. Carrier and bailees We will not make any payments under this policy to the benefit of any carrier or other bailee of damaged or lost property.

For liability, you also agree not to bring any action against us until the amount of damages you are legally obligated to pay has been finally determined after an actual trial or appeal, if any, or by a written agreement between you, us and the claimant. No person or organization has any right under this policy to bring us into any action to determine the liability of a covered person. 11/20/23 Illinois Policy Terms Page Y-5 © Chubb.2016 All rights reserved. Form no. 7000012 5/85 10/04/23 14:01:25 Reference Copy Policy Terms Special Conditions (continued) Appraisals If you or we fail to agree on the amount of loss, you or we may demand an appraisal of the loss. Each party will select an appraiser within 20 days after receiving written request from the other. The two appraisers will select a third appraiser. If they cannot agree on a third appraiser within 15 days, you or we may request that the selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction. Written agreement signed by any two of the three appraisers shall set the amount of the loss. However, the maximum amount we will pay for a loss is the applicable amount of coverage even if the amount of the loss is determined to be greater by appraisal. Each appraiser will be paid by the party selecting the appraiser. Other expenses of the appraisal and the compensation of the third appraiser shall be shared equally by you and us. However, we will pay your appraiser's fee and the third appraiser's fee if you demanded the appraisal and the full amount of loss, as set by your appraiser, is agreed to by our appraiser or by the third appraiser. We do not waive our rights under this policy by agreeing to an appraisal. Mortgagee or loss payee If a mortgagee or loss payee is named in this policy, any loss payable will be paid to the mortgagee or loss payee and you, as interests appear. If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgagees. We cover the interests of the loss payee unless the loss results from fraudulent acts or omissions on your part. If we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee or loss payee, provided that the mortgagee or loss payee: notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee or loss payee is aware; pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so. Policy conditions relating to appraisals and legal action against us, apply to the mortgagee and loss payee. If the policy is cancelled or not renewed by us, the mortgagee or loss payee will be notified at least 10 days before the date cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect. If we pay the mortgagee or loss payee for any loss and deny payment to you, then: our rights are subrogated to all rights of the mortgagee or loss payee granted under the mortgage on the property; or at our option, we may pay to the mortgagee or loss payee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer from the mortgagee or loss payee and all securities held as collateral to the debt. Subrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee or loss payee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's or loss payee's claim. Nonrenewal If we decline to renew this policy, we will mail such nonrenewal to you at the last known mailing address at least 30 days before the policy ends, with any nonrenewal reasons permitted by law. We will obtain a certificate of mailing. A copy of the notice will also be sent to the last known mortgagee or lienholder named in this policy. 11/20/23 Illinois Policy Terms Page Y-6 © Chubb.2016 All rights reserved.

If a quote doesn’t have any underwriting or warning messages indicating that approval is needed, it is approved. When present, underwriting rule messages indicate why a quote requires further underwriting review. Once underwriting or warning messages are addressed, the quote can be submitted for underwriting review using ‘Submit for Review’ in Neo. • ‘ Submit for Review’ is a function in Neo enabling the request of underwriting review through the system. It is the primary and preferred method for underwriting review. The ‘Submit for Review’ button is visible in Neo throughout the quote screens.• When selecting ‘Submit for Review’ a pop-up box appears with the opportunity to add a note to the request. Providing good information in the pop-up box will help advance the underwriting review, including: - Elevation Certificates or Wind Mitigation Reports - Loss details including cause of loss, where it occurred and any post-loss mitigation efforts - Client details such as occupation and history with the agency - Assignment of drivers to losses - Property details including unit number for a condo or prior carrier inspection - Answers to underwriting messages\n",
