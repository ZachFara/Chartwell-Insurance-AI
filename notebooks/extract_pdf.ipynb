Our share is the proportion that the amount of coverage provided under this policy bears to the total of all applicable amounts of insurance covering the loss, except as follows:\\n\\n- Lease gap coverage: If Lease gap coverage applies to a covered loss, that coverage is excess over any other insurance.\\n- Valuable articles: If there is other insurance in the name of a consignor, gallery, auction house or museum, covering the same property covered by us, our coverage shall be in excess of a loss covered under the other insurance.\\n\\n# Your duties after a loss\\n\\nIf you have a loss this policy may cover, you must perform these duties:\\n\\n1. Notification. You must immediately notify us or your agent of your loss. In case of theft or accident, you must also notify the police or similar competent authority.\\n2. Protect property.

Attach bills, receipts, and other documents to support your inventory.\\n4. Display property. You must show us the damaged property when we ask.\\n5. Proof of loss. You must submit to us your signed, sworn proof of loss providing all information and documentation we request such as the cause of loss, inventories, receipts, repair estimates and other similar records.\\n\\nReference Copy\\n\\n11/20/23\\n\\nIllinois Policy Terms\\n\\nPage Y-4\\n\\n© Chubb.2016 All rights reserved.

If they cannot agree on a third appraiser within 15 days, you or we may request that the selection be made by a judge of a court having jurisdiction.

However, we will pay your appraiser's fee and the third appraiser's fee if you demanded the appraisal and the full amount of loss, as set by your appraiser, is agreed to by our appraiser or by the third appraiser.

If more than one mortgagee is named, the order of payment will be the same as the order of precedence of the mortgagees. We cover the interests of the loss payee unless the loss results from fraudulent acts or omissions on your part.\\n\\nIf we deny your claim, that denial will not apply to a valid claim of the mortgagee or loss payee, provided that the mortgagee or loss payee:\\n\\n- notifies us of any change in ownership, occupancy, or substantial change in risk of which the mortgagee or loss payee is aware;\\n- pays any premium due under this policy on demand if you have neglected to pay the premium; and\\n- submits a signed, sworn statement of loss within 60 days after receiving notice from us of your failure to do so.\\n\\nPolicy conditions relating to appraisals and legal action against us, apply to the mortgagee and loss payee. If the policy is cancelled or not renewed by us, the mortgagee or loss payee will be notified at least 10 days before the date cancellation or nonrenewal takes effect.\\n\\nIf we pay the mortgagee or loss payee for any loss and deny payment to you, then:\\n\\n- our rights are subrogated to all rights of the mortgagee or loss payee granted under the mortgage on the property; or\\n- at our option, we may pay to the mortgagee or loss payee the whole principal on the mortgage plus any accrued interest. In this event, we will receive a full assignment and transfer from the mortgagee or loss payee and all securities held as collateral to the debt.\\n\\nSubrogation will not impair the right of the mortgagee or loss payee to recover the full amount of the mortgagee's or loss payee's claim.\\n\\n# Nonrenewal\\n\\nIf we decline to renew this policy, we will mail such nonrenewal to you at the last known mailing address at least 30 days before the policy ends, with any nonrenewal reasons permitted by law.
